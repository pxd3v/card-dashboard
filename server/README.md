# Card Dashboard Backend

A service for managing Stripe Issuing card data.

## ðŸ“Š Data Models

- **Card** - Stripe Issuing card information
- **Authorization** - Card closed authorization attempts
- **Transaction** - Captured Card transactions
- **MerchantCategory** - Merchant categorization data
- **Operation** - Unified view of authorizations and transactions
- **SyncState** - Tracks synchronization progress

## Core Features

- **Sync data through stripe webhooks** - Handles `issuing_authorization.created` and `issuing_transaction.created` events
- **Cron Job to constantly check if any data is missing** - From 10 to 10 minutes we check if card data is missing (to fallback in case webhook fails or app goes offline)
- **Incremental Sync** - Only fetches new data since last sync
